Discord

Discord – User Bots
- - /search keyword:... --- Does a search on the Discords/Twitters 
- /cmid url:... --- Takes a URL that has a live mint, and returns mint information and the CMv2 ID on it 
- /token address:... --- Get Fox Token Market info from a WL token address 
- /wallet_tokens: address:... Get Fox Token Market info for all tokens in an address 
- token_name: --- Same as token, but fetches token data by the token's name rather than the token's address 
- add_token_name: --- Add a custom name to a token. The token must exist in the database and must not already have a custom name

Discord – Automated Bots
- - daily-mints - Automated posts about upcoming NFTs, along with Twitter/Discord stats
- - analytics-etc - Shows when names are added to WL tokens in Fox Token market (either officially or by other users)
- mint-alerts-automated - a live feed that parses mints from the discords / twitters we watch.
- discord-inv-parser - Detects when discord links are sent, with the same message having the words "whitelist" "wl" or "og" in it.
- twitter-influencers - Shows posts made by dozens of SOL Twitter influencers / analysts. These are then stored in our database to be searched on
