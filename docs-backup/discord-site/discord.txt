mint-alerts-automated - channel explanation
This is a live feed that parses links from the discords / twitters we watch. It alerts when any link could contain a new mint, before or while it is released. The mint must be linked from two discords before it shows up. Candy Machine ID and mint details are also posted, if found


The majority of the time, people in other discords will just post a link to a new mint, and not tag others. Using this, you no longer need to be in discord / twitter all day to catch certain hyped mints. You also have more confidence in these mints, as multiple discords will be linking / discussing them, thus showing hype and demand
